### Welcome 👋

I'm a technical writer with a passion for crafting quality documentation and learning all things technical writing-related. 

The following are a few things about me.

✍️ I am a workaholic who enjoys creating documentation in my free time just for fun. You can check out my [My Wrting](https://github.com/heykayla/my-writing) repository to see the technical documents I have produced. 

🌱 I am a lover of learning, and I'm currently teaching myself Git and DITA.

🐙 I am a contributor to the [Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/). The Good Docs Project is an open source community that focuses on developing templates and writing instructions to improve open source software documentation.

⚡ Fun fact: I installed a Little Free Library in my college community as a part of a class project for my Technical Writing I class. I'm very proud of this accomplishment, and it warms my heart to see community members using it. 📚
